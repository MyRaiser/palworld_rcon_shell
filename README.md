# why this project?

1. there should be a way to sending commands to PalWorld server.
2. PalWorld server's RCON has a problem with response id, which makes `rcon.source.Client` raises `SessionTimeout`.

 This project provides a quick fix for the Client and a REPL environment to performing operations on server.

 At present, version of PalWorld is `v1.3.0`.

 # how to use
